# Compare SSH keys and Github token
Both GitHub tokens and SSH keys are used for authentication when interacting with GitHub repositories, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here’s a comparison:

## SSH keys
#### Definition
- SSH (Secure Shell) keys are a pair of cryptographic keys used to authenticate with remote servers and services, including GitHub.

#### Types
- Consists of a public key and a private key. The public key is added to the GitHub account, while the private key remains on the user's local machine.

#### Usage
- Used primarily for cloning, pulling, and pushing to repositories over SSH.
- Not used for API requests.

#### Permissions
- Provides access to repositories and actions configured in the GitHub account settings.
- Less fine-grained control compared to tokens; access is generally all-or-nothing.

#### Security
- Generally more secure for interactive and automated Git operations.
- Private keys should be protected with strong passwords and stored securely.
- If a private key is compromised, it should be revoked and replaced immediately.

#### Ease of Use
- Requires initial setup, including generating key pairs and adding the public key to the GitHub account.
- Once set up, SSH keys provide a seamless authentication experience without requiring repeated password inputs.

## Github Tokens

#### Definition
A GitHub token is a string of characters that acts as a key for authenticating with GitHub’s API and performing actions on behalf of a user.
#### Types
- Personal Access Tokens (PATs): Used for accessing the GitHub API.
- OAuth Tokens: Used by OAuth apps to perform actions on behalf of users.
- GitHub Apps Tokens: Used by GitHub Apps to authenticate as the app or on behalf of a user.
#### Usage
- Used for authenticating API requests.
- Can be used to clone, pull, and push to repositories over HTTPS.

#### Permissions
- Fine-grained permissions can be set for what actions a token can perform.
- Tokens can be limited to specific repositories.

#### Security
- Should be stored securely and not hard-coded in scripts.
- Can be revoked or regenerated if compromised.
#### Ease of Use
- Easier to set up for users who are not familiar with SSH.
- Can be used directly in scripts and CI/CD pipelines.

## Comparison of GitHub Token and SSH Key

| Feature                    | GitHub Token                                | SSH Key                                  |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Usage**                  | API requests, HTTPS git operations          | SSH git operations                        |
| **Authentication**         | String of characters                        | Public/Private key pair                   |
| **Permissions**            | Fine-grained, specific to repositories      | Broad access based on key setup           |
| **Security**               | Can be regenerated/revoked                  | Secure if private key is protected        |
| **Setup**                  | Easier, no special setup required           | Requires generating and adding keys       |
| **Use in Scripts**         | Directly used in scripts and CI/CD          | Requires SSH agent or key management      |
| **Passwordless Auth**      | No, tokens can be exposed                   | Yes, after initial setup                  |
| **Revocation**             | Easily revocable from GitHub settings       | Requires manual revocation from account   |

## When to Use Each

**GitHub Token**: Use when you need fine-grained control over permissions, are making API requests, or need an easy setup for automation scripts and CI/CD pipelines.

**SSH Key**: Use when you want a secure and passwordless method for git operations, especially for frequent interactions with repositories. Ideal for interactive use and automated environments where SSH is already set up.
