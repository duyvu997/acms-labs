# What is node-gyp
node-gyp is a tool used for compiling native C/C++ addons for Nodejs. It's crucial when you are using or building Node.js modules that contain native code, like interacting with low-level system libraries or achieving higher performance tasks. 

# Key feature
- compiling native addons
- cross-platform
- binding.gyp configuration 
- dependency management

# Installation
It's usually installed automatically with Node.js packages, but if you need it explicitly, you can install it globally:
```
npm install -g node-gyp
```

However, to work properly, you'll need the following setup:
- python (usually 2.x. though later versions work with patches)
- C++ Build Tools (e.g, `build-essential` for Linux or Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows)
